/* Get all the products available in the market */

SELECT * FROM farmers_market.product;

/*
*   Explanation:
*   The SELECT * statement retrieves all columns from the product table in the farmers_market schema.
*   While using * is convenient, it is recommended to explicitly list column names to avoid issues when new columns are added or modified.
