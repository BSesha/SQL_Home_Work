# SQL_Home_Work  

This repository contains my SQL practice exercises, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced queries. It serves as a learning and experimentation space for SQL, and there is **no guarantee** that the queries are suitable for production use. They are purely for **practice and educational purposes**.  

## Features  
- Covers **fundamental SQL concepts** (SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY,WINDOW FUNCTIONS etc.)  
- Includes **advanced SQL techniques** (stored procedures, triggers, indexing, etc.)  
- Designed for **learning and experimentation**  

## Usage  
Feel free to explore the SQL scripts and modify them as needed. Since this repository is for practice, queries may not be optimized for real-world applications.  

## License  
This repository is **open to everyone**. You may use the files **as-is** and modify them freely.  

## Contributions  
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional SQL exercises, feel free to submit a pull request.  

Happy querying! ðŸš€
